      The Math Whale Project is an experimental software exercise that intends to mix the colors
      green and blue to form a sea green effect. What pain discounts itself as is examinated with
      various means to track and re-route personal journeys to better outcomes.
      Our different sections highlight specs of our project in great detail to get you onboarded
      with these conceptual pieces of text.

    <h4>Boundaries Manual</h4>

      It's highly encouraged to use the suggested outlets as stated in the Boundaries Manual to stay within the
      bounds of this voluntary exercise.

        1. The Blame Game.<br>
        This one tops all the other greys.<br>
        <br>
        Yes, it's an intended pun of love.<br>
        Love for self or the other?<br>
        <br>
        You did me wrong, and I chose to do wrong.<br>
        You did me wrong, and I didnt choose to do wrong, because you did me wrong.<br>
        You did me wrong, so I had no other choice.<br>
        You did me wrong, so I had to prove that.<br>
        You did me wrong, so I had to prove myself.<br>
        You did me wrong, so I had to prove what's right.<br>
        <br>
        A circus of rights and wrongs only lead to a satisfying end of what's true.<br>
        Truth, like pain, also drapes itself skillfullly. It's the backbone of why we exist:<br>
        why we subject ourselves at the expense of others, or for others.<br>
        The end: Love is true. The truth is love.<br>

        2. Outlets.<br>
        Covering up your feelings?<br>
        <br>
        Talk to friends and family to get perspective.<br>
        WWhen you realize they can only help you gain the perspectives they have of the world,<br>
        which can apply at different times but not immediately.<br>
        <br>
        Sleep. Eat. Shop. Workout. Distract yourself with a movie. Better yet, a funny movie.<br>
        Time heals. Cry. Lie. Buy time. Buy happiness. Buy this, buy that. Instantly forget<br>
        whatever's on your mind. Do drugs. Instant gratification not helping?<br>
        <br>
        Call a helpline to get perspective.<br>
        The strangers are even more distant in the advice they have to give than friends and family?<br>
        <br>
        The only outlet to pain, is to think about it.<br>
        About how much whatever is troubling you means to you.<br>
        And finally, about how you can apply what you've dealt with and then understood<br>
        to help others who deal with the same emotions, deal with them better. Map it.<br>
        <br>
        You're your only source and remedy to your feelings.<br>
        Person A is his only source and remedy to his feelings.<br>
        Person B is her only source and rememdy to her feelings.<br>
        Person C is their only surce and remedy to their feelings.<br>
        <br>
        But this solo jounrey of 'outlets' is commonly divisible for the whole of society.<br>
        Hence, the realization of it remains the same, unchanged. Map or no map.<br>

        3. Have fun. <br>
        "Laughter is the best medicine."<br>
        Yeah, as the aftermath.<br>
        <br>
        Laughter can have positive effects on your health. So can pain.<br>
        <br>
        To dismiss one emotion with another, and for another, is stupid.
        Stupid because it works only as a temporary pitstop.<br>
        <br>
        Argument: Why not shape together a chain of only beautiful happy moments?<br>
        A long chain of temporary pitstops on a loop.<br>
        Like sunflowers.<br>
        <br>
        Have fun with that.<br>

        Quicktip: We find ourselves through the observation of others and the interactions we have with them.
        Even though other people cannot be of immediate relief when we're feeling stuck in our heads, to draw
        from their strenghts and weaknesses, to learn from their personalities and use that to shape the way you
        experience the world is the best and most available option at hand. We're all picking up on things form
        one another whether we realize it or not. And the more clean headed we are about our observations of others,
        it's that much easier to pay attention to their way of seeig and doing things in this world. Label it not
        copycat whores but copycat chores. Purity has no limitations or boundaries, and that's the only hack to the
        manual of combating pain.
