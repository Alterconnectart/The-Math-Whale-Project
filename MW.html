      <p id="explain">
      The Math Whale Project is an experimental software exercise that intends to mix the colors
      green and blue to form a sea green effect. What pain discounts itself as is examinated with
      various means to track and re-route personal journeys to better outcomes.
      Our different sections highlight specs of our project in great detail to get you onboarded
      with these conceptual pieces of text.

      Everyone experiences pain in different measures which can not be compared to another.
      What we find is inherently common though, are the ways we deal with the different
      manifestations of pain, and how we can positively or even negatively utilise them to
      live with a kinder state of mind, towards ourselves, our immedidiate circles of friends,
      family, and strangers.<br>
      <br>
      To be more perceptive to the other, sea deeper into how we find meaning in occurances, why
      we take the decisions we take, to hopefully then become more mindful of our participation
      in the consumption of resources available to us at any given time, and save the planet, and
      ourselves, and all the big things, for the n-th time.<br>
    </p>

      Disclaimer 2: Warning.<br>
      <br>
      It is a risk to reference this project off of the blue whale challenge that took place
      in 2016 in various countries. To summarise, it 'targeted' the weaker, more emotional aspects
      within our society, by asking younger groups of individuals to play, who were more susceptible
      to experiencing pain in drastic senses within the gray areas of seeming irrationalities.<br>
      <br>
      We cap our age limit to adults here because this project is designed to rework our perspectives
      towards others in a more realised state of durability of each other. As more neutral versions of
      ourselves, we can identify the shortcomings, the peak points, and complexity of human behavior
      through the lens of listed breakpoint suggestions.<br>
      <br>
      To identify would be the first step to being aware of spectrums that exist in each of us, dormant
      or not. This step should then be necessarily followed by perceptibility to emotions within ourselves
      to the limits of understanding empathy in all its degrees.

      Its found that the second step is the most time and attention consuming task for all subjects,
      the ones experiencing pain as well as the ones studying it.

      While a child experiences pain in a more elaborate sense, as adults we feel equally at distant
      with our emotions at times. Not to suggest that some feel more than others, but just like in
      any cyclic chain of events, the ones who are subjected to seeking knowledge more predominantly,
      on the path of pain, tend to also find it with the help of perspectives, opening doorways to
      the ones who are yet to be in similar en-routes.<br>
      <br>
      It is easy to disregard the journeys some people are on, in the name of humanity as a whole,
      to keep mentalities safe and all cherry. Nobody likes to see the darkness that presents itself
      for what it is, least of all the people who aren't forcefully subjected to it. The helpless ones
      either subdue their outlooks on life to be accepted in a working society, or they give up on
      connecting with the ones who've had it easy. This choice of outcomes only harms all by increasing
      mistrust in each other, and giving way to a more isolated way of being. This grey zone of
      interactions is also where all of the answers lie to the megaproblems of society.

      To save the one percent of us who do find themselves in the dark vague is a necessary suit that
      should be crafted rightfully so, for the sake of everyone. <br>
      <br>
      To use a metaphor, like with any machine, if any of the parts aren't functional, the entire
      system suffers in some way. And it's only a matter of time until chance decides which parts
      get the junk on them. The only limitation of this metaphor, that in turn completes it in this instance, is that
      instead of having the option to throw away the parts, we need to learn to clean them. Ourselves.

      For others to realise those perspectives, learn something from the happened, and apply it towards
      their own understanding of others, can save everyone a whole bracket of time and expenses, and
      funnily so, pain and suffering.<br>
      <br>
      Pain is an inherent part of living, that drapes itself in a variety of other forms.
      It is a necessary tool for existing. No one likes it, and everyone has to deal with it.
